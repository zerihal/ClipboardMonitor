Notification based library for Windows clipboard monitoring. This monitors the system clipboard for new items being added on a background subscription to fire an callback whenever data is added, optionally (default) providing a reference to the data type and data itself or source. See https://github.com/zerihal/ClipboardMonitor for details on methods and usage.
